All practical tasks of the course "[Global] Automated Testing Foundations with JavaScript"

Task1: NodeJS and Dependency Management

    1. Install LST NodeJs version
    2. Initialize package.json
    3. Install fs-extra package globally
    4. Install fs-extra package globally with --save-dev

Task2: Continuous Integration with Jenkins

    1. clone code from the repository: https://github.com/stranger2626/mocha-unit-testing-example 
    2. install dependencies with npm
    3. run npm run test

Task3: Conditional Statements and Data Types

    1. Perform addition of various types (string + boolean, string + number, number + boolean)
    2. Perform multiplication of various types (string * boolean, string * number, number * boolean)
    3. Divide different types (string / boolean, string / number, number / Boolean)
    4. Perform explicit conversion (number, string, boolean)
	
Task4: Objects and Functions

    1. Create a car object, add a color property to it with the value equals 'black'
    2. Change the color property of the car object to 'green'
    3. Add the power property to the car object, which is a function and displays the engine power to the console
    4. Pears and apples are accepted to the warehouse, write a function that returns the result of adding the number of accepted pears and apples
    5. Your name is saved in the payment terminal, write a function to define the name in the terminal (if you entered your name, then hello + name, if not, then there is no such name)
    6. Write a function for calculating the type of argument and type output to the console
    7. Write a function that determines whether a number is prime or not
	
Task5: Arrays and Cycles

    1. Given an array consisting of movie names, iterate over the array with the output of the names of each movie to the console
    2. Given an array of car manufacturers, convert the array to a string and back to an array
    3. Given an array of the names of your friends, add the words hello to each element of the array
    4. Convert numeric array to Boolean
    5. Sort the array [1,6,7,8,3,4,5,6] in descending order
    6. Filter array [1,6,7,8,3,4,5,6] by value> 3
    7. Write a function that takes two parameters - an array and a number and outputs the index of an array element equal to a number
    ﻿8. Implement a loop that will print the number 'a' until it is less than 10
    9. Implement a loop that prints prime numbers to the console
    10. Implement a loop that prints odd numbers to the console
	
Task6: Prototype and Inheritance, Classes, Constructor

	1. Create 2 objects: animal and cat, add move property to animal object, cat object must inherit move property from object animal
	
Task7: String, RegExp, DataTime

    1. Given the string 'ahb acb aeb aeeb adcb axeb'. Write a regular expression that matches the strings ahb, acb, aeb by pattern: letter 'a', any character, letter 'b'
    2. Given the string '2 + 3 223 2223'. Write a regex that finds line 2 + 3 without capturing the rest
    3. Get the day, month and year of the current date and output it to the console separately
	
Task8: Exception handling

	1. In a try catch construction, wrap the code: console.log (a), let a = 3. And display an error - ‘let must be declared’ before use. When running 1/0, the error 'cannot be divided by zero'
